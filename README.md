# The Quick Fox

A multiplayer mobile game controlled by your camera and your abilities to make origami.

Grab some paper and a pen, and try to be faster than your opponent or youâ€™ll be the lazy dog.

Because this game works with machine learning, the optimal way to play is by using a non-white surface and white square paper.
